State Capitals Trivia Game

Week 5 Assignment: Trivia Game

Created during week5 of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a timed trivia game. I allotted only 15 seconds to each question. After all of the questions are finished, the final scoreboard of how well you did will appear.

I wanted to create a state capitals trivia game because my oldest daughter has gotten into learning her states and capitals, and I thought it would be fun for if she could learn on a game that her dad made.
